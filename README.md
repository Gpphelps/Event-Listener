# Event Listener()
Event Listener() is a mobile-first web application that helps users find events based on their current location or a searched location. Currently, Event Listener() is limited to locations in North America.

## Link to Deployed Application
[Event Listener()](https://gpphelps.github.io/Event-Listener/index.html)

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Materialize
* JavaScript
* Ticketmaster Discovery API
* Leaflet.js API
* OpenCage API
 
## Work Completed

* Chetan was responsible for creating our HTML page layouts.
* Teisha provided styling using Materialize, overriding with a custom style sheet when needed.
* Gene implemented the  Leaflet.js maps and the OpenCage search bar
* Brett implemented the query to the Ticketmaster Discovery API and the display of the event data.
 
## Learnings and Issues

Some of the learnings we're taking away from this project are:
1. How to use Github in a team environment.
2. Learning the Materialize Framework.
3. Getting information from one API to match the required format of another API when passing data between the two.
4. Project management and how to collaborate to create a build upon an MVP.


## Future Application Updates

* Implementing other event APIs such as the Twitch API to include more types of events, and virtual events so that the user has more options.
* Adding the ability to select any location in the world.
* Adding the ability to select a location by clicking on the map.
* Improving the overall design to be more fluid across all screen sizes.
* Implementing  click events  for the links to Ticketmaster, on our second page,  so that a new tab is opened instead of the window being changed.
* Having the second page’s markers display the events location as well as the name of the event.
* Implementing navigation functionality or linkage to the user’s navigation app of choice.
* Filtering by event type ie. sporting events, and or concerts, and or theatre performances.
